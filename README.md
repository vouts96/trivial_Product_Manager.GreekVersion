# trivial_Product_Manager.GreekVersion
My father wanted an app to keep track of his product stock in his store, so I made one.
This is a black window app that I created when I was in 1st year of my ECE studies.
It contains very low level programming(e.g. I implemented myself list classes and their methods).
It is all in Greek(sorry for that)! The idea is an immitation of database based on file reading/writing.
